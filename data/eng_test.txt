gnored. Consequently, the mainstream media seems to have fully committed itself to a new narrative, one that liberals had hoped it would adopt for some time: McCain is lying, a lot. Obama is hitting on the theme as well in statements and a new ad which call into question McCain’s honor. But could complaints about McCain’s dishonesty end up hurting Obama more than McCain’s dishonesty hurts McCain?
• Marc Ambinder says the McCain campaign has “gone thoroughly post-modern on us,” claiming there is no such thing as truth. The press has finally turned on McCain, creating a “narrative” of him as a distorter. But the Obama campaign maintains “that McCain isn’t paying a penalty for deliberately, knowingly and willfully misleading people.” [Atlantic]
• Mickey Kaus suggests the liberal blogs and mainstream media drop the tactic of getting outraged by McCain’s lies. “MSM outrage doesn’t sway voters anymore,” especially after the failed “assault” on Palin. Plus, it makes Democrats look weak, which, while unfair, is the reality they have to deal with. [Kausfiles/Slate]
• Michael Scherer writes that the backlash to McCain’s strategy of faux outrage and misleading claims “has not yet had an impact on voter’s perceptions of McCain’s credibility though, with the press emboldened, that could change.” So far, McCain’s favorables have gone up more than his unfavorables. [Time]
• Steve Chapman claims that while “politicians are not saints, and campaigns are not conducted under oath,” the McCain campaign’s dishonesty “is of an entirely different scale and character.” He could simply run against Obama on the issues, but “McCain has concluded that a fact-based case about Obama isn’t enough to prevail in November.” While he may not be willing to lose a war to win an election, he is willing lose “his soul.” [Reason]
• Andrew Sullivan contends McCain “needs to be exposed as the dishonest, despicable, desperate and dishonorable cynic he has become.” [Atlantic]
• Ezra Klein partially defends the McCain campaign’s “decision to lie about, well, everything,” as “a rational and obvious response to the rules laid down by the media.” As the McCain campaign claims, nobody in the media covered McCain when he was quietly talking about policy issues earlier in the year. The media feeds on conflict. Still, while it doesn’t justify “sacrific[ing] his honor and dignity with astonishing enthusiasm,” McCain is simply “following the incentive structure laid out by the media.” [American Prospect]
• Carrie Budoff Brown examines how Obama has been responding recently to McCain. The “hopemonger” has vanished, and in its place a less optimistic Obama is trying to be tougher without getting “into the mud.” Recently, the Obama campaign seems “determined to get under McCain’s skin by using words that evoke military service to question his campaign tactics, which they have described as ‘dishonorable’ and lacking integrity.” [Politico]
• Michael Goodwin finds it “weird” that Obama would start getting tough on McCain now since he’s “been doing exactly that for four months … The problem is that he hasn’t done anything else.” The decision to drop the “post-partisan uniter” for “a party man who sees the other side as evil and beneath contempt” will likely turn off independents and should “end the myth that the Obama campaign is a flawless machine.” [NYDN]
• Jonathan Capehart likes the new Obama ad, which “juxtaposes McCain’s own promise to run an honorable campaign with the blizzard of criticism he has received for ads that perpetuate outright lies,” and suggests he “now needs to stay on offense.” [Post Partisan/WP]
• Greg Sargent expects the ad to be met, “without question,” with the POW card. [Election Central/Talking Points Memo]
• Chuck Todd and friends write that, for “someone who prides himself on his ‘straight talk,’” McCain had a “brutal weekend” in the media. And in addition to being called out on his lies by the press, the Obama campaign “is doubling down on this criticism.” But “[d]o campaigns that complain about tone win? Are those campaigns ahead when they complain about negativity?” [First Read/MSNBC]

Unfashionable James Frey Loves Fashion

This, at least, is true: James Frey is a fashion-show fan. “I go to shows every year,” the Bright Shiny Morning author said at the Geren Ford show at the Bowery Hotel this week. “I think Fashion Week’s cool. I’m not particularly fashionable, and I don’t wear fashionable clothes, but I love the spectacle of it.” Just how unfashionable is he? “You’re pretty much looking at it,” he said. “Khakis, T-shirt, and Adidas shower sandals.” But he owns one swankier item that he pulls out for the February shows. “I have a black mink coat,” he said. “When my wife and I moved to New York from Los Angeles, I was like, ‘Well, if you’re gonna make me move, you have to go get me a fur coat.’ I thought it was hilarious. I wear a T-shirt under it.”

The AP Calls McCain a Lying Liar From Liartown

Palin Plays the Church Lady With Charlie Gibson

Clips from tonight’s ABC News interview with Sarah Palin are already online, and it looks like she survives the first round pretty well unscathed. In the transcript released by the network, Charles Gibson begins the interview by asking whether she could “look this country in the eye” and say she’s experienced enough to one day be president of the United States. Palin didn’t hesitate before saying, “I do, Charlie.” She said she also had her answer ready, without hesitation, when John McCain asked her to be his running mate. She never questioned whether she was ready. “Doesn’t that take a little hubris?” Gibson asked. “You can’t blink,” she replied.
In the rest of the interview, Gibson questioned her regarding her statements (delivered in her church) that U.S. soldiers were “on a task from God.” Palin insisted she was paraphrasing Abraham Lincoln, but stepped back from the sentiment when it regarded her son, Track, who decamped for Iraq today. “I don’t know if it is a task from God, Charlie. What I know is that my son has made a decision.” She nearly sounded as if she were lecturing Gibson in Sunday School, and kept using his name as though he was a small child. (Gibson appeared unimpressed by this tactic.)
When the World News Tonight anchor began to gently press her on her foreign policy, Palin had ready answers about Georgia and the Ukraine’s entries into NATO, but stopped short of saying the U.S. should go to war with Russia if, after Georgia’s inclusion in the treaty, Russia once again invaded. “We have got to show support, in this case, for Georgia,” she said. “The support that we can show is economic sanctions against Russia if this is what it leads to.” She also said — three separate times — that we must avoid a new Cold War.
On the whole, Palin seemed a bit unsettled by the intimacy of the interview (she has spent the last week in front of screaming crowds, after all), but she handled herself well. If the rest of the interviews are this short, we’re betting she will continue to come off polished and prepared. The next thing her critics will ask for, of course, is a more unscripted, hour-long appearance on a show like Meet the Press. Don’t expect it anytime soon, however. We’ll have to survive on these Palin bits and pieces for the foreseeable future.

New York ‘Post’ Officially a ‘Joke’

On the seventh anniversary of September 11, arguably the greatest tragedy ever to take place on American soil and a catastrophic event that changed New York City forever, the editors of the New York Post decided that it would be appropriate to put a gag Photoshopped image of a pig wearing lipstick on the cover of the paper. Remembrance of 9/11 (which occupies most of the Daily News cover) is relegated to a tiny note in the upper right-hand corner. We’re used to this kind of gag from the tabloid (we’re still laughing about their V-D Day cover), but this surprised even us. The ridiculous lipstick kerfuffle is a two-day story? On a day when even McCain and Obama have pulled all TV ads and have agreed to appear together at ground zero, the Post still thinks silly wisecracks take precedent over solemnity? Guess it is, officially, the paper of jokers now.

Ironically, ‘Bridge to Nowhere’ Taking Campaigns to Exciting New Places

Before getting into the recent political resuscitation of the Bridge to Nowhere controversy, it would be useful to set forth the actual facts. (See Jonathan Allen’s helpful guide in CQ Politics for the full story.) In 2005, Congress gave Alaska a $223-million earmark for a bridge to connect Ketchikan to Gravina Island — population 50. After an outcry, Congress removed the earmark for the bridge specifically, but allowed Alaska to keep the money for any transportation projects it saw fit. When Sarah Palin ran for governor in 2006, she supported building the bridge, even though the money no longer had to be spent on it. Once she became governor, she kept the money but turned against the project, and it wasn’t built. There, done. Fast-forward to last week at the Republican National Convention: Palin claimed that she told Congress “Thanks, but no thanks” on the bridge. “If our state wanted a bridge, I said we’d build it ourselves.” Since then, the campaign has touted Palin’s bridge-killing heroism on the stump and in a new ad, “Original Mavericks.” Barack Obama has taken particular umbrage at this claim, a main plank of the McCain campaign’s recent re-branding as the “reformer/maverick/change-agent” ticket. Yesterday he began blasting the dubious assertion in appearances on the campaign trail, on Countdown with Keith Olbermann, and in his own ad, uncreatively titled “No Mavericks.” And, slowly, the media is taking notice.
• Josh Marshall thinks we may be “witnessing the first stirrings of a backlash and a dawning realization that the ‘Sarah Palin’ we’ve heard so much about over the last few days is a fraud of truly comical dimensions.” At the risk of hyperbole, “not a single word that comes out of her mouth … is anything but a lie.” [Talking Points Memo]
• Mike Madden notes that in its defense of Palin’s record on the bridge, the McCain campaign is ignoring key details, “glossing over exactly how long it took for her” to turn against the bridge. [War Room/Salon]
• Jim Geraghty takes the same tactic as the McCain campaign, noting that Palin killed the bridge but declining to address her previous support. He also points out that Obama and Biden have flip-flopped on things too. (!) [Corner/National Review]
• Andrew Romano calls it “completely misleading to portray Palin as a ‘crusader for the thrifty use of tax dollars’ and claim, as the Alaska governor did in her convention speech last week, that she” turned down Congress’ offer to fund the bridge. In the past, the mainstream media would have covered this distortion once and then let it go, but now the Internet is forcing folks to stay on top of the story. [Stumper/Newsweek]
• Steve Benen is struck by the Obama ad’s “use of the word ‘lying,’ which is both aggressive and accurate under the circumstances.” The new sharper aggressiveness will likely “thrill” party backers. [Political Animal/Washington Monthly]
• Joe Klein thinks the Obama ad is “tougher” and “more effective” than previous efforts. [Swampland/Time]
• Howard Kurtz labels the “Original Mavericks” ad’s bridge claim a “whopper.” [Trail/WP]
• Yuval Levin points out that while Palin “should have opposed [the bridge] to begin with, as McCain did” it’s “a little odd for Obama to argue that point” since he voted for the earmark in the Senate. [Corner/National Review]
• Elizabeth Holmes and Laura Meckler report that the McCain campaign is repeating the bridge assertion “[d]espite significant evidence to the contrary.” [WSJ]
• Matt Yglesias gives credit to The Wall Street Journal, but contends that what really matters “isn’t one-off articles but campaign narratives.” If the media were so inclined, “there’s a fairly obvious narrative about John McCain that could be built around his campaign’s penchant for repeating false claims about bridges, opponents’ tax plans, etc.” [Think Progress]
• Arianna Huffington warns that “McCain’s team, in an effort to distract, is going to keep doing what they’re doing — diverting voters and the media with a tantalizing combination of personal trivia and small lies.” [HuffPo]

Sarah Palin and the Media Announce Cease-fire

We all know how dreadful and unprofessional the media has acted toward Sarah Palin since her surprise debut on the national stage. Asking questions about her positions and examining her life and experiences — it was all way out of line, and the McCain campaign wasn’t shy about saying so. After complaining of Palin’s treatment for a week, the McCain campaign told The Atlantic’s Marc Ambinder on Friday that if the liberal media elites wanted answers directly from the pit bull’s mouth, they would have to wait. Palin wouldn’t do any interviews with the media until she was “ready” and “comfortable,” which “might not be for a long while.” But then they quickly changed strategy, announcing Sunday that Palin would sit down with ABC News’ Charlie Gibson later this week. However, many are already skeptical about grandfatherly Gibson’s ability to ask the tough questions. And it’s clear that despite a brief cease-fire, the McCain campaign sees the spat with the media as a war worth fighting. 
• Chuck Todd and friends suggest some of the questions Palin may face: “Without mentioning her supervision of the Alaskan National Guard (a task all governors have), her state’s proximity to Russia, and her son’s military service, what qualifies her to be commander-in-chief in such turbulent times?” Or, how about, “Why did she originally back the infamous Bridge to Nowhere?” [First Read/MSNBC]
• Steve Benen claims Charles Gibson is being rewarded for his friendly McCain interview during the Republican National Convention, in which McCain made assertions that were “demonstrably false, but Gibson didn’t challenge McCain on any of them.” Palin should do fine in the interview, and while Gibson may feel a need to make up for his performance with McCain, “he probably doesn’t want to lose his shot at the first exclusive sit-down with Todd Palin.” [Political Animal/Washington Monthly]
• Josh Marshall notes that “multiple interviews” will be done with Gibson over two days, which is far from the norm for political interviews because “it makes the questioning entirely at the discretion of the person being interviewed and their handlers.” The interviewer has to be on his “best behavior” at least until the last interview, or risk losing access to the candidate. Consequently, the Gibson interview will be “unwatchable.” [Talking Points Memo]
• Glenn Thrush is less skeptical, wondering how Palin will “hold up under a grilling about the future of NATO, the mortgage securitization crisis or Troopergate,” and contends that even after tutorials with Joe Lieberman, “the potential for embarrassment remains significant.” [Politico]
• Peter A. Brown writes that the McCain campaign’s battle against the media is a strategy that “builds on frustration with almost all things Washington, D.C., and the public perception that the news media is just another part of the governing elite there.” It’s novel for a campaign to use such a tactic “during the closing months of a presidential campaign.” The media is viewed rather poorly by the American public, which is why “you can expect to see Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin taking shots at the news media from now through November.” [Political Perceptions/WSJ]
• David Carr writes that “while Ms. Palin may be unfamiliar to the hosts of Sunday morning political shows and to readers of the letters page of The Washington Post,” readers of women’s magazines will see in her “the ideal blend of femininity and toughness, mother and mayor, good girl and governor.” She is, in fact, one of the “archetypes” of the modern media. [NYT]
• Howard Kurtz explores the media’s treatment of Palin and concludes that while “[t]here is a touch of condescension in the way some pundits have talked about this moose-hunting woman from a distant frontier … some of the anti-press criticism has been silly.” The McCain campaign has lumped together the mainstream media with tabloids and blogs in its critiques. While the backlash against the media “has already fostered sympathy for Palin,” some worry that “the McCain team has gone too far” and is fighting a losing strategy. [WP]
• Ezra Klein finds it amusing and incoherent that the media itself is attempting to report on whether the media covered Palin unfairly. “Watching them try to examine this story is sadly hilarious, like watching a puppy unhappily considering whether it has, in fact, been a bad dog,” he writes. [American Prospect]
• Jay Carney and Michael Scherer believe the “metastasis of informal, and unreliable, information sources online” has complicated the debate over media coverage. It’s unclear whether the McCain campaign’s conflation of those outlets with the mainstream media has been real (and understandable considering “the dramatic changes in the media landscape between the 2004 and 2008 elections”) or “convenient strategy.” [Time] 
• William Kristol thanks “our friends in the liberal media establishment.” Its “feeding frenzy” coverage “hyped interest in [Palin’s] speech” and “engendered not just interest in but sympathy for Palin.” [Weekly Standard]

NBC Tells Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews to Go to Their Rooms and Think About What They’ve Done

They gave them a chance. But they could not get along. After weeks of on-air squabbles, and amid accusations of political bias (such as the chants of “NBC! NBC!” that erupted during Sarah Palin’s speech the other night), MSNBC has taken lightning rods Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann away from prime-time coverage of the presidential election, remanded them back to their own shows, and replaced them with a more sanguine host, reporter David Gregory — much to the relief of those at NBC who felt the duo’s antics were compromising the news organization as a whole.

St. Paul Report: David Carr on Why This Will Be the Last Convention of Its Kind

Last night’s Google/Vanity Fair RNC capper party didn’t have the wattage of the DNC equivalent bash, which boasted guests from John Kerry to Susan Sarandon. Instead, we found ourselves milling around with Fred Thompson and Henry Kissinger (both of whom, tellingly, refused to talk about McCain’s speech), and a whole bunch of exhausted reporters. It had been a long two weeks on the road. Politico.com’s Ben Smith said his kids have started playing a game called “Airport,” in which his flights get canceled before he reaches the campaign trail. In another corner, we overheard David Brooks saying his children ask his wife if Daddy is dead. Glynnis MacNicol of Mediabistro’s FishbowlNY started off her birthday that day having an early breakfast with Karl Rove. And WWD’s Jacob Bernstein was counting down the seconds till he could go home and check on his dog, who had been rushed into emergency surgery for bloat. 
But it was David Carr, perhaps our favorite person on earth, who gave us the best, most colorful assessment of what it was like to be a reporter here.

St. Paul Report: Eugene Mirman, Chicken Run Afoul of Secret Service

During both the Democratic and Republican conventions, Daily Show correspondents frequently found themselves in trouble with the powers that be. Hearsay has it that in Denver, after Jason Jones pretended to pee on a campfire (he used a water gun) that happened to be near a local Fox News station’s van, he was accused of peeing on their equipment. “I heard they were trying to hunt us down and take our credentials away,” John Oliver told us. “They made us sound like Spinal Tap!” So imagine being an upstart correspondent for the fledgling Huffington Post–related comedy site, 23/6. Their RNC credentials wouldn’t even get them inside the Xcel Center; these they traded for some passes that didn’t allow for the shooting of video. But in the maverick spirit of John McCain, they ignored such technicalities. That is, until their on-air personality, New York comedian Eugene Mirman, had a little incident with some chicken. 
As part of a gag where Mirman would play a reporter embedded with protesters, the crew went to an Army-Navy supply store and picked up an orange hunter’s vest, goggles, a crash helmet — and a packet that heats up a delicious meal of herb-lemon chicken when you pull a string. When they couldn’t find a “serious” protest, they headed back to the Xcel Center and decided, so the day wouldn’t seem like a total wash, to film Mirman sitting at a table in the convention hall, eating his self-heating chicken.  Mirman pulled the string. “It’s heating for about ten minutes. We’re sitting at a table. Nobody’s around. It doesn’t seem like a big deal,” Mirman told us. “Then all of a sudden, smoke starts coming out of it.” This was just minutes before Sarah Palin was set to take the stage. Cameraman Ari Boles said he looked up seconds later and they were surrounded by twelve men wearing suits and earpieces, some of whom identified themselves as Secret Service. “They’re like, ‘Why is your pocket on fire?’” says Mirman. “And I’m like, ‘It’s not on fire. I just have an herb-lemon chicken!’” 
After bringing Mirman and Boles to a makeshift situation room, the Secret Service determined them “not dangerous” and left. The RNC credentials overlord persisted — “He said, ‘I have to figure out whether my trust has been betrayed,’” says Mirman — and revoked their borrowed passes. But Mirman says the overlord turned out to be “really nice and sweet.” He even let Boles get a free drink from the lounge, then walked them out and said goodbye. “I hope his life turns out well,” says Mirman. His only regret? The Secret Service confiscated the chicken.

‘Times’ to Consolidate Sections

In order to save on printing costs, the Times will cut the number of sections it has in the paper by folding the “Metro” and “Sports” sections into other sections of the newspaper, reports the Observer today: “According to newsroom sources, the Metro Section is moving into the A-section and the Sports section will move into the Business section for some portion of the week.” Okay, combining the “Metro” and front sections makes sense, but “Sports” and “Business” is kind of weird, no?

Is the New York ‘Sun’ Finally Setting? I Hope Not

On the morning of Semptember 23, 2003, it was pouring rain. I was walking to my first day of paid work in journalism, as a news assistant to the editor-in-chief of the New York Sun, Seth Lipsky. To say that I was nervous would be an understatement — I had already heard that Lipsky was gruff and a challenge to work for. But I was determined to make the perfect impression. During my job search, the Sun was the only print outlet in the city (I sent my résumé to a couple dozen) that had even granted me an interview. Before leaving the apartment I had selected my favorite tie and blazer. But by the time I reached the office, I was soaked from head to toe, and my blazer clung to my sides like an eighties party dress. So I resignedly took it off, along with my tie, and hung it up in a window to dry as I sat down to work. Shortly afterward, Seth Lipsky stormed into the newsroom for the day. Without even pausing to look me over, he grumbled, “You can’t look like that. You have to wear a suit every day.” Before I could protest, he entered his office and shut the door behind him.
It was an inauspicious beginning. Throughout the entire time I worked there, I continued to be terrified of Seth Lipsky. Even though the Sun had existed for barely a year, Lipsky (who had previously edited the Forward) acted like a hardened, old-school newspaper editor. He wrote with beautiful fountain pens and insisted on very specific kinds of stationery. He was always ready with a lesson in journalism history, and had each of his editorials bound into a set of tasteful hardcover volumes.
His professionalism was mismatched with the company, which was really a hardscrabble start-up — the office (which is featured in the end of The Devil Wears Prada) never had its heating right, and it couldn’t keep a staff. But I think Lipsky knew this, and maintained his sense of seriousness and dignity at all times to pass on to his writers and editors the weight of their responsibility. It certainly worked. While I was there and afterward, the Sun squeezed better writing out of a younger, smaller staff than I think any other paper in the city.
That’s why I came to love the New York Sun. I once asked Lipsky why he had hired me, since I didn’t know anybody and had no strings to pull. (This was, I assumed, why I hadn’t gotten an interview anywhere else.) “I hired you because you were the most qualified for the job,” he said, as though any other reason would be ridiculous. Within a year, I was covering metro stories, and saw my byline on the front page of a New York paper. Sure, it was a small paper with a meager subscription base, but it was the kind of “local reporting” experience you’re told you need before working at a major paper — and I didn’t have to go to Topeka to do it.
People often asked me if the paper’s neoconservative, Zionist politics bothered me, because those were what most everyone seems to know about it. They never did. For one thing, the paper’s editorial stance was pro-gay and evenhanded on city issues, I thought. Plus, their sense of conservatism was steeped in a sense of history (American and theological) and in loyalty to the men and women the paper’s editors deemed good and honorable. I was, in fact, inspired to see a set of people who were working because they believed in something. The Sun was launched in New York because a set of high-profile moneymen wanted a certain voice to be heard in New York. That voice was a combination of Lipsky’s graceful style and the vociferous opinions of managing editor Ira Stoll. (He was founder of the critical blog Smarter Times. Also terrifying, FYI.) Even when I was there everyone knew the paper wouldn’t have the financing to last forever. But it made it longer than we all anticipated, because investors (and a fair amount of readers) found its voice to be lyrical and wise.
Now, according to Lipsky, the Sun may be on its last legs. Simply put, this makes me sad. There is so much great writing in that paper, from daily scoops to wonderful cultural writing. (I’m told the sports coverage is good, too, but let’s face it, I have no idea.) Seth Lipsky just wanted the best things for journalism in general. When I got my first freelance assignment ever, it was for Hustler magazine. I was terrified to ask him permission, and when I did, he urged me to reconsider — your clips, he argued, make who you are as a writer. (I told him I needed the money, and he understood. You know how we have that question in our “21 Questions” list about whether you’d live in the city on $35,000 a year? Yeah, I know my answer.) When I got a job at the Daily News, he encouraged me and we kept in touch. In fact, his regular (and catalogued) correspondence and friendship with members of the media both high and low were another testament to his enthusiasm for the medium.
I hope the Sun doesn’t stop “shining for all” in the end. But if it does, it will be remembered by me and by many others whose careers it launched, as a funny, scary, and wonderful place. It may be old-fashioned, but it has been anything but tired. And most of all, it’s been brave. The city has been better for its existence.

Peggy Noonan on McCain’s Campaign After Palin Pick: ‘It’s Over’

While offscreen at an outdoor MSNBC studio, conservative Republican pundits Peggy Noonan and Mike Murphy trashed John McCain’s choice to select Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. Murphy, who contributes to Time and MSNBC, called it “cynical” and “gimmicky,” adding, “It’s not going to work.” Noonan went further, saying, “It’s over.” She went on, unaware that her mike was still on:
Jiminy Cricket! God bless hot mikes. The McCain fans over at Fox News have gotta be bummed they resurrected that trend. You can hear the dialogue in the above video. What’s especially telling about this is not that Republicans are grumbling privately about the risky move of choosing the relatively unknown (and slightly baggage-heavy) Palin. It’s that they’re doing it while publicly voicing support for the choice. Murphy basically echoes what he said in an even-handed post about Palin last week on Time.com’s Swampland blog. 
But Noonan was outlining why the “Hail Mary” move on McCain’s part just might work. “Most Hail Mary passes don’t work,” she wrote. “But when they do they’re a thing of beauty and a joy forever.” Noonan later concluded, “[Palin] is a real and present danger to the American left, and to the Obama candidacy.” If anything, excuse us, that now sounds like political bullshit.
According to Noonan:
Noonan adds that she doesn’t, in fact, think McCain’s campaign is “over.” She also apologized for using the word “bullshit,” which is too bad, because that was the best part of the whole tape.

Rachel Maddow: ‘It’s Hilarious That ‘Page Six’ Just Runs Stuff That They Make Up’

Photo: WikiCommons Fiery but polite Rachel Maddow has just fired the latest salvo in the war between “Page Six” and MSNBC. After the tabloid gossip column suggested that she may need to straighten up her sense of style yesterday, the new cable host was asked about the feud in an online Q&A on TVNewser. Blogger Ron Mwangaguhunga asked: “There was a lighthearted Page Six story this week about MSNBC making you wear fancy clothes. Question: Is it intimidating to now be on Page Six’s radar?” Maddow replied:
Ooooh, slice. We can’t wait until the writers of the gossip column come up with a response. If her politics, co-workers, and clothes have already been pilloried, we already know what’s next … her hair. And that’s going to get “Page Six” in trouble — you do NOT talk to a lesbian about her short haircut. It’s like talking to a black lady about her weave: dangerous.

Sarah Palin Jokes: Is McCain’s V.P. Making Politics Funny Again?

This one at least gets an A for effort.Photo: an email forward.Last week Jon Stewart addressed the issue of whether Obama and McCain were giving enough material to comedians. He argued that, while the two candidates aren’t hilarious on their own, it is the media and other politicians who are having trouble drawing the line between what should be taken seriously and what should be made light of. Well, now that we’ve got a former-beauty-pageant-contestant vice-presidential candidate who was a small-town mayor three years ago, and who has a pregnant, unmarried 17-year-old daughter, do we all know what’s funny? Mmm, not quite. Below are some of the jokes we’ve seen about Sarah Palin over the last three days, divided into things that made us laugh and things that made us cringe. 
As Hilarious As Imagining Amy Poehler and Kristen Wiig’s Auditions to Play Palin on Saturday Night Live
• “There was also some breaking news out of Dayton, Ohio, today where this morning Republican presidential candidate John McCain introduced the world to his third wife — actually, no, I’m sorry, that’s his running mate Sarah Palin, the freshman governor of Alaska, and star and producer of Emmy-winning 30 Rock. No, I apologize, the star of the Emmy-winning Will & Grace. No, no, I’m sorry, it’s actually the mild-mannered and troubled librarian from every Cinemax movie.” —Jon Stewart
• “She does know about international relations because she is right up there in Alaska, right next-door to Russia.”  — Fox News’ Steve Doocy “When you think about it, Alaska is also near the North Pole, so she must also be friends with Santa.” —Jon Stewart
• “GRAN ‘OL PARTY” —Today’s Daily News cover
• “She’s not bad-looking. She looks like one of those women in the Van Halen videos who takes off her glasses, shakes out her hair, and then all of a sudden, she’s in high heels and a bikini. All of a sudden, I am FOR drilling in Alaska.” —Jimmy Kimmel
• “I think this is pertinent because McCain has been running this campaign based on ‘we’re at war, it’s a dangerous world out there. The Democrats don’t get that. I, John McCain, am the only one standing between the bloodthirsty Al Qaedas and you. But if I die, this stewardess can handle it.’” —Bill Maher
About As Laughable As a Punchline That Relies on the Word “Retard”
• “Palin and McCain are a good pair. She’s pro-life and he’s clinging to life.” —Jay Leno
• “Does any of you have the phone number for Lynne Spears? I totally think we are going to be BFFs :)” —From the fake Sarah Palin blog
• “Are you kidding me, the mayor of Wasilla, Alaska? Yeah, that’s who you want in the White House during a time of crisis. When she got a phone call at 3 in the morning, it was because a moose had gotten in the garbage can.” —Bill Maher
• “It’s the vice presidential debate. The moment Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin mentions Hillary, Joe Biden does a Lloyd Bentsen: ‘I know Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton is a friend of mine, and Governor, you’re no Hillary Clinton.’ But here’s Palin’s drop-dead reply: ‘Senator, I know your running mate, Barack Obama. And he’s no Hillary Clinton either.’” —Margery Eagan 
• “Actually, it was kind of a smart choice. McCain went with a woman because he didn’t want to have to be in a position to have to get CPR from Mitt Romney.” —Jay Leno
• “She has unwittingly and literally become the poster child for her mother’s anti-choice and abstinence-only education policies.” —Bonnie Fuller
•  “There’s a gigantic difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and between me and I suspect my vice presidential opponent. She’s good-looking.” —Joe Biden  
• “Wonkette Pregnancy Expert Sara K. Smith decrees that these whispers about Sarah Palin not being that baby’s mama are absurd, because everybody knows John Edwards is the mother of that baby.” —Wonkette Pregnancy Expert Sara K. Smith
• “Five kids? Does anyone in that party understand the concept of pulling out?” —Bill Maher

Does Rachel Maddow Need to ‘Straighten’ Up?

 Photo: Getty Images (Couric body), wikipedia (Maddow)Did anybody notice that “Page Six” had a sorta sexist item about new MSNBC host Rachel Maddow today? Here’s a section:
The item is titled “WAY TO SKIRT THE ISSUE.” We get the “skirt” pun, but what “issue” is it exactly that they are avoiding? That she’s a lesbian and thereby inherently unappealing? That’s not cool.
In the column’s defense, it claims the story comes from MSNBC sources. But given its occasionally line-crossing machismo toward women reporters and bizarre obsession with making the network look bad, combined with MSNBC’s increasingly namby-pamby liberal lean, we’re not so sure we buy it. 
Nevertheless, we’ve helpfully juxtaposed a photo of Maddow in her natural appearance with one that “Page Six”/MSNBC would allegedly prefer. (If you can’t tell, it’s her head Photoshopped onto Katie Couric’s glorious, leggy body.) Last week we expressed hesitation about her shoe choice, but general approval of her look altogether. Do you think she needs a makeover?

Matt Lauer on MSNBC: ‘Maybe a Unified Network Would Be Nice’

Photo: Getty ImagesWe spotted Matt Lauer and exec producer of Today Jim Bell waiting for a car at the Ritz to take them back to New York tonight, causing them to miss the Obama speech. What gives? “I’d love to be standing there watching it, but that way I wouldn’t get back to the show tomorrow,” Lauer explained. We then asked him if he has been steering clear of the madness at his sister channel, MSNBC:
Lauer: [With laughter] What madness are you talking about?
Lauer: SciFi network? No, we try to keep a healthy distance from madness, but I’m not sure what’s going on and I’ll let it play out among all the parties involved. We have enough drama on our own show that we can keep ourselves busy…
New York: Maybe after the convention you’ll be unified!
Lauer: Yeah, I think since people are looking for a unified country, maybe a unified network would be nice.
Bell: Yes! We! Can!
Lauer: Change we can believe in.

How Is Hippie MSNBC President Phil Griffin Dealing With All the Rage on His Network?

Joe Scarborough, Rachel Maddow, Keith Olbermann, and Chris Matthews as you may recognize them from their other roles in TheHills.Photo-illustration: Getty Images, wikipedia(Maddow); Courtesyof MTVFor a long time, MSNBC head honcho Phil Griffin only had to worry about managing a verbal war with competitor Fox News. Then Tim Russert died. Russert was a man who, even in death, could make rainbows appear out of thin air. But now that he’s gone, Griffin is left with Joe Scarborough, Chris Matthews, David Shuster, and Keith Olbermann — all of whom seem to actually loathe one another. Openly. On camera. It’s enough bad karma to make MSNBC broadcast in black-and-white.
After a week of Gawker and the Huffington Post covering the scuffles, print media finally picked up on the story. The Wall Street Journal chronicled the mess and superbly quoted former MSNBC’er Connie Chung as saying, “‘Grow up!’ They have to just grow up.” Politico also took on the story and tied it to the network’s growing pains as it shifts more firmly to the left.
So why can’t Phil Griffin, the love guru, control all of these guys? Apparently because he doesn’t want to. “Look, I want honest, authentic people on our air. I don’t want phonies. So if the price of that is every once in a while one of these bubbles up, I’m not concerned,” he told the Journal. But it’s so much tension! Surely that can’t be good for your Anahata chakra. 
And yet Griffin does have his own way of dealing with this. “Like any good manager, I give and I take and I massage and I deal with it,” he said. Massage? Dude, we’re clearly at the point where that won’t be enough. You may have to yoga that shit out.

 Editor’s Russell Crowe Impression Does Not Go Over Well in Newsroom

Only Russell can throw a phone and have it mean something.Photo: Getty ImagesTime was, if a newspaperman threw something or yelled, it was because he was passionate, not crazy. Ian Bishop was probably hearkening back to that time when, after a frustrating phone conversation, he tossed a phone in the direction of the office of managing editor Stuart Marques. The expression of emotion was symbolic at best and essentially pretty weak — Marques wasn’t even in his office at the time — but Bishop was still suspended. And over at the Post they’re reveling over “the latest turmoil to rock the Daily News newsroom” like the proverbial pigs in shit. Keith Kelly quotes inside sources for colorful detail.

The ‘Times’ Helps Us Keep Up With the Riches

The Riches, clockwise from left: Alex, Frank, Nathaniel, and Simon. Photo: Patrick McMullan, Adrian Kinloch (Simon)Summer can be a busy time. People are in and out of town, you’re on vacation, and everybody is just trying to relax. So it’s often hard to keep up with what your friends are doing (one weekend we thought our roommate was in Fire Island, and it turned out he was skiing. In Dubai.) But thanks to the New York Times, there’s one family we all grew up with whose summer activities are no mystery: the Riches. 
You can never quite forget about the Rich dynasty. Papa Frank’s eloquent columns always take up slightly too much of your Sunday afternoons, and son Simon Rich occasionally surprises you when his contributions to The New Yorker’s “Shouts and Murmers” column turn it into something that actually makes you laugh. Stepmama Alex Witchel’s byline isn’t as common at the Times as it once was, but once in a while she will do something like change your entire TV viewing habits with one magazine story. 
Still, reading their work is different from knowing what they are actually doing, which is a boundary the Times has helped the Royal Richenbaums cross this summer.
Frank Rich took nearly a month’s two weeks of vacation, from the end of July until early August. It would have been relaxing, except for while he was gone everybody started talking about how Obama was going to lose.
For son Simon, however, there was no rest for the weary. The summer is the only time cast members and writers (like him) of Saturday Night Live can really focus on side projects, so the young humorist took advantage of the past few months to work with Bill Hader to write an Internet series called The Line. The shorts co-star John Lutz, Joe Lo Truglio, and Jason Sudeikis, and are directed by Seth Meyers. Yeah. You went to Jones Beach one time, right? That must have been a thrill.
Oh, and Simon was also nominated for a Thurber Prize for humor writing. 
Brother Nathaniel Rich spent some time exploring the city’s public pools because he missed the cooling effects of his summer-camp swims in Maine. (He continued to go every summer for years until he was a counselor, FYI.) He even treated Times readers to this particularly precious tidbit, which occurred moments after he plunged into the kiddie pool in Tompkins Square Park: “When I finally boarded the cross-town M14, wearing just my bathing suit and flip-flops, a young boy screamed and told me to put on my shirt. I’m pretty sure he was jealous.”
While he wasn’t freelancing for his father and stepmom’s paper, Nathaniel was working on some writing of his own. He’s crafting something that he tentatively is calling FutureWorld, which is funny, because the movie that everyone in Simon’s Internet series is waiting to see is called FutureSpace. Such Richian synergy!
Which brings us to today, when we learned that Alex Witchel recently spent an afternoon making burritos with Simon’s best friend Josh from high school. When they were finished, Simon came over to help eat them. After a summer of knowing exactly what  the Riches are up to, readers are now invited to sit down and have dinner with them through the page. How fitting! It’s better than having to do it in person, because if you did that, you would instantly die of genetic shame.

Jared Paul Stern’s Dirty Laundry Not Limited to Skull & Bones Overstock

Snoodles, with Jared Paul Stern.Photo: Patrick McMullanOkay, remember Jared Paul Stern, the former “Page Six” gossipmonger who was seemingly busted by billionaire Ron Burkle for extortion but later had his name cleared? The writer who, after launching a relatively unsuccessful clothing line, went on to launch a relatively unsuccessful lawsuit against Burkle? Yeah, well his troubles aren’t over. Jossip reports that Stern’s wife, Ruth “Snoodles” Gutman, is embroiled in a scandal of both the business and sexual kind. According to the Website, which has court papers, a former colleague of Gutman’s is accusing her of identity theft, computer trespassing, and fraud — relating to an entrepreneurial endeavor involving something called “Bear Paw Hand Cleaner.” (That is so random we can’t even possibly get into it.) He says she tried to scam him out of credit and money for his involvement. The accusations have led to a warrant out for Gutman’s arrest. Which would be bad enough, except that the former co-worker also claims that he had an affair with her. Stern dismisses the accusations against his wife and calls the man, Deane Bebenek, a “stalker.” 
The problem with that is, there’s photo evidence of the affair, and Jossip has seen it. Which isn’t a legal issue or anything, but gross. We bet Jossip was just trying to get out of the office for the weekend when all of this fell into their laps. If there’s anything worse than having to deal with obscure news developments on an August Friday, it’s having to look at sex pictures of people who aren’t celebrities.

Greatest Unknown Yankee Discovered

So maybe Emeril isn’t the greatest chef, either?
Apparently the magazine didn’t verify anything beyond the fact that Pulliam was a full-time artist, and after his story ran, in an article titled “The Natural,” a reader called their attention to the fact that Pulliam had never played in the majors. (This isn’t terribly hard to verify, by the way.) So the magazine, presumably hard at work on September’s Sidd Finch cover story, did a little bit of belated fact-checking and found he’d never played for the Yankees (or for the University of Florida, as he also claimed). Yankee officials also confirmed to them that his painting of the stadium never hung in the team’s offices, and we’ll go out on a limb and confirm they were laughing pretty hard when they fielded that phone call.
We’re not sure what Pulliam’s endgame was — publicity, we guess, since even after confronted with evidence that his baseball career was fabricated, he insisted that the parts about celebrities owning his work were true. But maybe he was just hoping to land a tryout with the Yankees for real. Considering their alternatives for this weekend, he couldn’t do much worse, could he?
